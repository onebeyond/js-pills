# Currying

This is a technique which involves converting a function which takes multiple arguments into a series of smaller cascaded functions which each take a single argument and return a function, except for the last cascaded function which returns the final result.

So essentially this is the transformation of a function that can be called as ```f(a, b, c)``` into a function that can be called as ```f(a)(b)(c)```.

## Example with javascript

Uncurried adder function taking multiple arguments:

```js
const adder = (a,b) => a+b
adder(99,1) === 100
```

Several examples of curried versions:

```js
const es6CurriedAdder = (a) => (b) => adder(a,b)
es6CurriedAdder(99)(1) === 100
```

```js
function oldSchoolCurriedAdder(a) { return adder.bind(null, a) }
oldSchoolCurriedAdder(99)(1) === 100
```

```js
const hybridCurriedAdder = (a) => adder.bind(null, a);
hybridCurriedAdder(99)(1) === 100
```


## Relationship to partial application

Partial application can be considered the binding of one or more arguments of a curried function

```js
const partiallyApplied = es6CurriedAdder(99)
partiallyApplied(1) === 100 
```
