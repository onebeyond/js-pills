# Clone Javascript Objects

Objects in Javascript are references values, so you can't just copy using assing operator `=`
```js
const car1 = { doors: 4, color: 'blue' };
const car2 = car1;
car2.doors = 2;
console.log(car2); //{ doors: 2, color: 'blue' };
console.log(car1); //{ doors: 2, color: 'blue' }; ðŸ‘€
```
I changed `car2` but `car1` also affected. It's because, when you use `=`, really you are copied the pointer to the memory space it occupies. Reference types don't hold values, they are a pointer to the value in memory. To achive _real_ clone, here are 2 ways:

## Shallow clone

It makes a superficial clone of an object

#### Using Object.assing

The oldest way to do it. How we want clone an object, we start with empty object `{}` for source

```js
const car1 = { doors: 4, color: 'blue' };
const car2 = Object.assing({}, car1)
car2.doors = 2;
console.log(car2); //{ doors: 2, color: 'blue' };
console.log(car1); //{ doors: 4, color: 'blue' }; âœ…
```

#### Using Spread Operator

Since ECMAScript 6, we have available spread operator ```...```

```js
const car1 = { doors: 4, color: 'blue' };
const car2 = { ...car1 };
car2.doors = 2;
console.log(car2); //{ doors: 2, color: 'blue' };
console.log(car1); //{ doors: 4, color: 'blue' }; âœ…
```

But remember, this way do a shallow clone. It means that, if you have nested objects, they won't be cloned and we'll have a reference again

```js
const car1 = { doors: 4, color: 'blue' };
car1.specs = { speed: 100, longitude: 300 };
const car2 = { ...car1 };
car2.specs.speed = 150
console.log(car2); //{ doors: 4, color: 'blue', specs: { speed: 150, longitude: 100} };
console.log(car1); //{ doors: 4, color: 'blue', specs: { speed: 150, longitude: 100} };  ðŸ‘€
```


## Deep clone: 

If we've interested on cloning nested objects too, we need a deep clone

#### Using JSON

This is a quick dirty way to get a deep clone. It has native support, so you don't need external deps. In practice, it is used more than it seems

```js
const car1 = { doors: 4, color: 'blue', specs: { speed: 100, longitude: 300 } };
const car2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(car1));
car2.specs.speed = 150
console.log(car2); //{ doors: 4, color: 'blue', specs: { speed: 150, longitude: 100} };
console.log(car1); //{ doors: 4, color: 'blue', specs: { speed: 100, longitude: 100} };  âœ…
```


But not everything is so good. JSON method doesn't work with functions and order of properties in the cloned object may be different 

```js
const car1 = { doors: 4, color: 'blue', specs: { speed: 100, longitude: 300 } };
car1.paint = function (newColor) { this.color = newColor };
const car2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(car1));
console.log(car2); //{ doors: 4, color: 'blue', specs: { speed: 100, longitude: 100}, paint: f };
console.log(car1); //{ doors: 4, color: 'blue', specs: { speed: 100, longitude: 100} };  ðŸ‘€
```

### Using external library

There are a lot of libraries (or you can create yourself ðŸ˜Ž) that have a method for deep cloning. The most famous for me is `lodash`

```js
import { cloneDeep } from 'lodash'

const car1 = { 
    doors: 4, 
    color: 'blue', 
    specs: { 
        speed: 100, 
        longitude: 300 
    }, 
    paint: function (newColor) { 
        this.color = newColor 
    } 
};
const car2 = cloneDeep(car1);
console.log(car2); //{ doors: 4, color: 'blue', specs: { speed: 100, longitude: 100}, paint: f };
console.log(car1); //{ doors: 4, color: 'blue', specs: { speed: 100, longitude: 100}, paint: f };  âœ…
```
